# Welcome to the Repository for the iOS and Steam Deck "Photon" Apps

### These iOS and Steam Deck apps are designed to transfer and sync media files between the iOS host device and Steam Deck respectively.

Click on the root folder of the app you want to install, and follow the instructions on the README displayed below the folder's file manager.

### Currently, the only app available right now is the iOS app, as the project is still very much a work in progress. When the Steam Deck app is in a presentable state, I will update the README inside that app's root folder with instructions on how to install it.
