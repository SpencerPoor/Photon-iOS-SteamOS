# Welcome to the Photon iOS app

This is the iOS arm of the Photon project created with [Expo](https://expo.dev)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

Each of these links will bring you to the respective Expo support pages on how to setup the necessary components needed to run this app via the listed methods. For development, I ran a development build on an iOS simulator running on macOS Sequoia.
